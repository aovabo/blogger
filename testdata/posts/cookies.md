abstract: "In this post, we simplify the world of internet cookies and data protection. Imagine going to your favourite local market - some vendors remember you and what you bought last time. That's what cookies do on the web, they remember you to make your experience easier. But, just like how you'd want to know if someone was sharing news about your purchases, it's important that websites tell you what they're doing with your data. That's where data protection laws come in. They're like community rules, making sure websites are honest about what they're doing."
