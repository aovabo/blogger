# Electrons and Algorithms: My Tesla Model 3 Experience and the Roadster Dream

Embarking on the electric journey with my **Tesla Model 3** has been a ride of discovery, not just of innovative transportation but also of the potential within automotive cybersecurity. Beyond the allure of electric mobility lies my ultimate aspiration: to claim the **Tesla Roadster** as both a reward and a symbol of mastery in automotive cybersecurity.

## The Electric Beginning

The moment I took the helm of my Model 3, I was propelled into a world where technology meets sustainability. The car's sleek aesthetics and immersive sound system were just the prelude to a deeper quest. However, the initial 15 miles on the odometer hinted at a journey that would be about more than just driving.

## Navigating the Digital Rain

An unexpected challenge arose with the car's wipers, which activated whimsically, devoid of any precipitation. This quirk led me down the path of troubleshooting, revealing it to be a firmware glitch—a first lesson in the intricacies of automotive software.

## Autopilot: The Double-Edged Sword

The Autopilot feature, a testament to Tesla's innovation, became a field for real-world testing. Its erratic behavior, from phantom braking to misinterpreting road commands, underscored the complexity of machine learning in action. Yet, it was in a snow-blanketed drive that Autopilot showcased its potential, guiding me with precision when visibility was compromised.

## The Cost of Learning

These technological quirks had tangible repercussions, notably on my insurance premium, which surged from $65 to $186 monthly due to adjustments in my safety score—a stark reminder of the real-world implications of software reliability.

## The Ultimate Quest
