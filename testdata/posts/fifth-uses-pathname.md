abstract: The used heavy equipment market in Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in Nigeria, is riddled with inefficiencies and marked by a lack of transparency. This paper proposes an innovative solution to these problems through the digitalization of the market, drawing on the personal experience of the author in a family-run construction and heavy equipment business in Nigeria. Using a combination of experiential insights and a market experiment involving 300 participants, we highlight the shared pain points of sellers, buyers, renters, and part sellers in the current market. We argue that a dedicated online platform can significantly improve market efficiency, trust, visibility, and profitability. Our pilot testing involving a WhatsApp group facilitated successful deals and validated our assumptions about the market. This paper concludes that a digital platform can resolve significant issues in the Nigerian heavy equipment market and potentially transform the heavy equipment industry across Sub-Saharan Africa.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem
Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an
unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen
book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
versions of Lorem Ipsum.
