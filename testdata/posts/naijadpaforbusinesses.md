## Introduction
As developers and security/privacy engineers, we are keenly aware of the significance of data privacy in the digital age, and are dedicated to aiding businesses in navigating the newly enacted Nigerian Data Protection Act 2023. This revolutionary legislation reflects the Nigerian government's commitment to protect personal data and bring its laws into the international data protection landscape.

In this blog post, we'll provide an overview of some of the key areas of the Act, and explain what Nigerian companies need to do to ensure compliance.

### Objectives of the Act
The Act's objectives are multi-pronged and holistic, designed to fortify the data subjects' rights under the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, regulate the processing of personal data, foster secure and privacy-conscious data processing practices, and ensure businesses meet their obligations to data subjects. The Act also aims to facilitate Nigeria's participation in the regional and global economies via trusted use of personal data.

### Application of the Act
The Act applies to the processing of personal data through any means, automated or not. It has jurisdiction over data controllers or processors operating in Nigeria, those processing personal data within Nigeria, and those handling data of subjects in Nigeria, even if they are not physically present in the country. Businesses should therefore determine if they fall under the jurisdiction of this Act, and if they do, ensure that their practices are in line with its requirements.

### Exemptions from the Act
The Act does not apply to personal data processed solely for personal or household purposes, provided such processing does not infringe upon the fundamental right to privacy of a data subject. Other exemptions include data processing carried out for preventing, detecting, investigating, or prosecuting a criminal offence, managing a public health emergency, ensuring national security, and in public interest such as journalism, education, artistic, and literary purposes. Also, the Act may not apply if the processing is necessary for establishing, exercising, or defending legal claims.

However, these exemptions come with some caveats. If any data processing exempted under this section, in the opinion of the Nigeria Data Protection Commission, violates or is likely to violate sections 24 and 25 of the Act (which pertain to the obligations of the data controller and processor), the Commission may issue a guidance notice containing legal safeguards and best practices to the data controller or processor. Thus, even if businesses believe they are exempt, they should stay vigilant and work towards best practices for data processing.

### What Constitutes Personal Data?

Personal data, as outlined in the Act, is any information relating to an individual who can be identified, either directly or indirectly. This includes, but is not limited to, names, emails, addresses, phone numbers, and other such identifying data.

### Does the Nigeria Data Protection Act 2023 Apply to Your Business?

If your business operates within Nigeria, or even if you're based elsewhere but process the personal data of Nigerian residents, the Act applies to you. This can include everything from having a physical branch in Nigeria to simply offering goods or services to Nigerian residents online.

### Why Should Your Business Care About the Nigeria Data Protection Act 2023?

Aside from the ethical implications of data privacy, there's a significant financial incentive to comply. Non-compliance can lead to fines of up to N10,000,000 or 2% of the global gross revenue of the preceding year for major data controllers and processors, and up to N2,000,000 or 2% of global gross revenue for others. It's not just about avoiding penalties though; demonstrating NDP Act compliance can instill trust in your customers and provide a competitive advantage.

### Fundamental Principles of the Nigeria Data Protection Act 2023

- Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency: Processing data must have a lawful basis and be conducted in a fair and transparent manner.

- Purpose Limitation: Data can only be processed for specific, explicitly stated, and legitimate purposes.

- Data Minimization: Only the minimal necessary data should be collected and processed.

- Accuracy: All data processed must be kept accurate and up-to-date.

- Storage Limitation: Data should be retained only for as long as necessary for the purpose it was collected.

- Integrity and Confidentiality (Security): Adequate security measures should be in place to protect the processed data.

- Accountability: Organizations must demonstrate compliance with all of the above principles.

### Rights Granted by the Nigeria Data Protection Act 2023

Much like the GDPR, the Nigeria Data Protection Act 2023 grants several rights to individuals regarding their personal data, including:

- Right to be informed about data collection and processing
- Right of access to their data
- Right to rectification of incorrect data
- Right to erasure, also known as the "right to be forgotten"
- Right to object to processing of their data
- Rights regarding automated decision making and profiling

The Nigeria Data Protection Act 2023 is an intricate piece of legislation, spanning numerous pages with various rules and provisions. This overview gives you a glimpse of its core tenets. To ensure complete compliance, consult with a legal expert or a data protection professional.
