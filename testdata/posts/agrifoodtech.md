## 1. **Understanding the African and Nigerian Farming Market**

The farming market in Africa, and particularly in Nigeria, is notably fragmented. Agriculture is a critical sector in Africa, employing about 70% of the continent's population in various roles. In Nigeria, the agricultural sector plays a substantial role in the economy, [employing over 35% of the workforce and contributing more than 20% of the GDP](https://research.agfunder.com/africa-agrifoodtech-investment-report-2023-08f5446bc7224fd5a3ce21f4451889f1.pdf). This is particularly noteworthy when compared to Ethiopia, where agriculture makes up an even larger portion, accounting for 40% of their GDP. A significant aspect of this sector is the dominance of smallholder women farmers; [they constitute 70% of the agricultural workforce and produce 60% of the food consumed in Nigeria](https://ng.boell.org/sites/default/files/2022-12/swofon-survey-final-draft.pdf). My mother, a smallholder farmer herself, is part of this significant demographic.

## 2. **Personal Experience and Market Changes**

Farming in Nigeria is not only becoming more expensive but is also fraught with numerous challenges, as observed through my mother's experiences. Economic costs are escalating, with [input prices for farming essentials rising faster than what the crops can fetch in the market](https://businessday.ng/agriculture/article/farmers-struggle-with-rising-inputs-cost/). The burden is compounded by the [rising costs of transportation](https://guardian.ng/features/transportation-costs-fueling-high-prices-of-food/), which affect everything from acquiring supplies to getting produce to the market. Environmental challenges, such as [frequent floods in Benue](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/floods-in-west-and-central-africa-destroy-crops-worsening-hunger-outlook) and [droughts in Bauchi](https://dailytrust.com/bauchi-state-under-threat-of-desertification-a-call-to-action/), further strain the farmers' ability to maintain consistent productivity. Security concerns, stemming from attacks by [herders](https://guardian.ng/features/agro-care/ondo-farmers-under-siege-seek-end-to-herders-carnage/) and [Boko Haram/Islamic State West Africa Province, terrorist groups](https://www.voaafrica.com/a/at-least-11-farmers-killed-by-jihadists-in-northeast-nigeria/7344209.html), add another layer of difficulty to their daily lives. These issues are compounded by problems like [low productivity](https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/nigeria-agriculture-sector) and [limited technology adoption](https://businessday.ng/agriculture/article/nigerias-agric-potential-hindered-by-low-technology/), exacerbated by the increasingly [unpredictable weather patterns due to climate change](https://www.cbn.gov.ng/OUT/2012/PUBLICATIONS/REPORTS/STD/EFFECTS%20OF%20GLOBAL%20CLIMATE%20CHANGE%20ON%20NIGERIAN%20AGRICULTURE.PDF).

Another significant challenge faced by smallholder farmers in Nigeria is land access and security. Under the [Nigeria Land Use Act](https://placng.org/lawsofnigeria/view2.php?sn=228), the government retains ownership of all lands, which can lead to situations where, despite legal land ownership, farmers can be displaced for government projects like road construction. My mother's story is a case in point; her first farm at Olu Foam, a source of pride, was taken away by the Ondo State government in 2008 under this Act, illustrating the precarious nature of land tenure for farmers in Nigeria.

Most Nigerian farmers, including my mother, are smallholders. She runs a small farm and has always been a part of the local agricultural community. One vivid aspect of this community is the 'Oja Oko,' a term in Yoruba language, predominantly spoken in Southwestern Nigeria, meaning 'bush market.' Oja Oko is akin to a farmer's market, where everyone brings their produce and food to sell. These markets, characteristic of rural Nigeria, are convened on specific market days. My mother used to find affordable produce at these markets, but recently, she mentioned that prices have risen sharply, now mirroring those in urban centers. This increase is primarily due to Nigeria's fluctuating naira and high inflation rates. Such economic pressures, combined with land tenure challenges, paint a vivid picture of the multifaceted struggles facing Nigerian farmers today.

## 3. **My Reaction to the Agriculture Demonstration Project and Call for Applications**

<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F_8q5ljWYAAJ96l?format=jpg&name=large"/>

The Agriculture Demonstration Project, introduced by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security, represents a significant and much-needed step towards advancing the adoption of agricultural technology in Nigeria. Currently, the landscape of agrifood technology companies in Africa, including Nigeria, shows a distinct trend. Companies like ThriveAgric in Nigeria, focusing on agribusiness marketplaces and fintech, and Wasoko in Kenya, specializing in in-store retail and restaurant technology, reflect the predominant focus areas in the sector. According to the [AgFunder Africa AgriFoodTech Investment Report 2023](https://research.agfunder.com/africa-agrifoodtech-investment-report-2023-08f5446bc7224fd5a3ce21f4451889f1.pdf), there has been more funding directed towards sectors like retail, marketplaces, and fintech than towards areas like mechanization and equipment, farm management software, IoT, and sensingâ€‹, which is why I was particularly excited about the [call for applications](https://x.com/bosuntijani/status/1729147958610797009?s=20). My enthusiasm stems from two key reasons:

- First, there are numerous startups and government initiatives in Nigeria that are addressing crucial issues like connecting producers with consumers, providing access to financing for farmers, and offering rental tractors. In fact, the Nigerian government, at both the state and federal levels, has a history of providing micro-financing, farm equipment, and farm inputs to farmers. I recall, during Governor Olusegun Mimiko's administration in Ondo State, the Ondo State Radiovision Corporation showcase his commissioning of the [Ore Agric Village](https://www.vanguardngr.com/2014/03/investing-agriculture-mimiko/) and they frequently had news segments where his commissioners were shown distributing [micro-loans]((https://dailytrust.com/ondo-gives-n23-9-million-to-70-young-farmers/)), [farm inputs]((https://allafrica.com/stories/201609140081.html)), and [farm equipment like tractors with disc plough, burrow, ridger, and tipping trailer](https://allafrica.com/stories/201403242053.html) to farmers. However, these initiatives often faced challenges such as lack of proper post-disbursement monitoring, accountability issues among some farmers, and inadequate enforcement by the government. From discussions with my mother's friend, it was clear that sometimes the farm inputs distributed to smallholder farmers arrived late. There are documented instances where Nigerian farmers used loans from the Bank of Agriculture and other government-funded programs for personal expenses like [throwing large parties or marrying new spouses](https://commodity.ng/warning-nigerians-against-taking-out-loans-to-get-married-or-throw-parties-bank-of-agriculture-claims-to-have-n243-million-in-debt/). There have also been cases of government officials in Nigeria [diverting government farm equipment for profit](https://humanglemedia.com/officials-are-diverting-government-tractors-for-profit-in-nigerias-borno-state/), by charging high rental prices for equipment that was meant to be loaned out cheaply to support farmers. There are also cases of farmers and government officials [side-selling and diverting farm inputs](https://dailypost.ng/2023/11/27/wheat-farming-fg-warns-against-selling-diversion-of-dry-season-inputs/). Some suppliers also sell [fake agricultural inputs in Nigeria and across Africa](https://businessday.ng/news/article/fg-sensitises-agro-stakeholders-on-spread-of-fake-agricultural-inputs/). They will paint the seed in a different color to deceive the buyers.

Second, the collaboration between the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security and the Federal Ministry of Communications, Innovation, and Digital Economy on this intervention is particularly noteworthy. It signifies a move away from outdated and inefficient agricultural practices towards the latest advancements in agricultural investments and innovation. This collaborative approach is vital as it demonstrates the application of UAV, IoT, AI, and Blockchain to agriculture in Nigeria, aiming to mainstream these technologies to revolutionize the sector and improve the livelihoods of millions of Nigerians. This is the first time I am reading about such an inter-ministry collaboration in Nigeria, which is a welcome development considering how the U.S Department of Agriculture has been striving to accelerate innovative technologies for water and agriculture-related resources. Since as far back as 2002, the United States Department of Agriculture established the [Rural Business Investment Company](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-7/subtitle-B/chapter-XLII/part-4290) to promote job creation and agricultural technology adoption in rural America. Similarly, the U.S. has a [Farm Credit System](https://farmcredit.com/), comprising banks and lending institutions federally chartered to serve agriculture and the rural economy, akin to Nigeria's [Bank of Agriculture]((https://boanig.com/)).

## 4. **Recommendations for Sustainable Growth**

To effectively tackle the challenges in Nigeria's agricultural sector, a collaborative approach involving various ministries and agencies is crucial. This approach should holistically address the multifaceted issues impacting agriculture, from logistics to policy reform. Here are my recommendations for making this intervention impactful and sustainable:

The Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security should not limit its partnership to the Ministry of Communications, Innovation, and Digital Economy alone. A more expansive collaboration is needed, involving the National Assembly, State Ministries of Lands and Housing, Ministry of Women Affairs, Ministry of Transportation, and particularly the Ministry of Police Affairs, given the ongoing issue of police extorting commercial drivers at multiple checkpoints. This not only hampers the transportation of agricultural products but also adds unnecessary costs and delays. The National Union of Road Transport Workers should also be involved to address the levies imposed on transporters, which contribute to the high cost and inefficiency in moving goods across states.

Further, the Ministry of Water Resources and Sanitation and the Office of the Surveyor General of the Federation should be engaged to tackle challenges related to irrigation, land use, and mapping â€“ critical areas for agricultural productivity.

In terms of financing and innovation, the role of the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Ministry of Finance is crucial. They should foster public-private partnerships, much like the U.S Department of Agriculture's collaboration with the Rural Business Investment Company. With venture capital funding in African agrifood tech on a decline, as noted in the Agfunder report, these partnerships are vital for injecting much-needed innovation and investments into the sector. The focus should not just be on retail and restaurant tech or agribusiness marketplaces and fintech, which currently attract most of the funding, but also on sectors like mechanization, equipment, farm management software, IoT, and sensing.

The Nigerian Agricultural Cooperative And Rural Development Bank (NACRDB) should play a pivotal role in incentivizing agricultural cooperatives. These cooperatives need support to enhance their operations and profitability through the adoption of agricultural technology. Leveraging the network and influence of these cooperatives can lead to a more widespread adoption of technology in farming practices.

Education and capacity building are also key. The National Universities Commission should revamp agricultural education, consolidating overlapping courses and introducing modern ones like Computational Agriculture and Agricultural Biotechnology. Partnering with universities for research and problem-solving in agriculture, similar to the USDA's partnership with Cornell University for the Computational Agriculture Initiative, can accelerate innovation in this sector.

Finally, addressing the Nigeria Land Use Act is imperative. As a personal witness to its impacts â€“ my mother lost her first farm due to this law â€“ I understand its detrimental effects on smallholder farmers. This law, which vests land ownership with the government, often leads to challenges in land tenure and utilization. Amending or repealing it would be a significant step toward empowering farmers and enhancing agricultural development.


By addressing these areas through strategic collaborations and policy reforms, Nigeria can significantly improve its agricultural sector, making it more efficient, sustainable, and globally competitive.


## 5. **My Vision for AgriFood Technologies for the Agriculture Demonstration Project**

If I were to apply to the program, my proposal would be under the banner of 'Robavo AgriFood Technologies', incubated by Ovabor Development Labs Limited. However, currently, my ability to apply is constrained as I am deeply engaged with scaling other ventures like AfriComply, eQuipfy, and SpaceSec, with the aim of nurturing them into billion-dollar companies. After achieving this milestone, my focus will shift to my interests in agri food tech, defense tech, and spacetech.

Hereâ€™s my envisioned approach for the Agriculture Demonstration Project:

- **Remote Sensing & IoT:** I would address the limitations of fixed-wing drones in agriculture, especially in tasks like spraying pesticides or carrying heavy mapping cameras. My solution would involve developing large Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) autonomous drones to overcome these challenges. Given that some farmers have difficulties with reading and lack awareness of the health and environmental impacts of pest control methods, creating a low-tech, easy-to-use drone for spraying is essential. This approach is particularly relevant considering that some farmers currently use rudimentary methods like mixing chemicals in basins and applying them with cassava leaves, often without proper protective equipment

- **Mechanization and Farm Robotics:** Leveraging the telematics developed at eQuipfy, I would explore transforming heavy equipment into autonomous machines for agricultural purposes. The focus would be on building autonomous farm equipment locally for weeding and harvesting. This innovation is crucial for addressing labor shortages and enhancing productivity through mechanization, moving away from traditional tools like cutlasses and hoes. Additionally, developing robots to assist in labor-intensive tasks could provide a modern alternative to the traditional tools distributed by politicians.

- **Farm Management Software & AI:** Utilizing advancements in computer vision and machine learning, I would develop systems to monitor crop health and optimize farm operations. A primary initiative would be building a soil data measurement and mapping solution. This technology would empower farmers to make informed cultivation decisions, improving yield, crop quality, and soil health sustainably and profitably. It would also save time and money by reducing the reliance on soil testing laboratories.

This proposal aims to provide economical and effective solutions for food safety and traceability across the production chain, leveraging the latest in technology. It includes the creation of smart irrigation systems, soil sensors, and the utilization of aerial imaging on drones. The objective is to automate and refine traditional crop monitoring, offering real-time, data-driven insights for yield improvement and efficient farm management.
