## A Brief History of Data Protection Laws in Nigeria
The road to data privacy in Nigeria has been an evolutionary process anchored by the constitutional provision for the right to privacy. Section 37 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria guarantees and protects the privacy of citizens, their homes, correspondence, telephone conversations, and telegraphic communications.

In 2013, the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) launched the NITDA Guidelines, setting standards for the processing of personal data, including its acquisition, handling, usage, and disclosure. Despite being a considerable leap towards data protection, these guidelines still left gaps that required a more comprehensive law.

The Nigerian Data Protection Regulation (NDPR), launched by NITDA in 2019, marked the next step in strengthening data protection, aiming to safeguard the rights of Nigerian citizens while also boosting the global competitiveness of Nigerian businesses.

Despite the strides made with the NDPR, it faced criticism due to its limited efficacy and enforceability, as it was not an Act of the National Assembly. This prompted the creation of the Data Protection Bill, which, on June 14, 2023, was signed into law by the President, officially becoming the Data Protection Act. This Act, being a comprehensive law, offers a binding legal framework for data protection in Nigeria.

## Understanding Nigeria's New Data Protection Act
Despite the considerable attention this legislative milestone has garnered, there persists ambiguity among the populace regarding the statute's precise implications. The Act does not pertain to the monetary value of internet data or government surveillance; rather, it serves to forestall the misuse of personal data. The legislation seeks to impose a robust legal structure that manages personal data processing, thus preserving individuals' privacy rights. The Act details the privileges of the data subjects (consumers), the obligations of the data controllers (entities managing data), and the role of the Data Protection Commission in ensuring adherence to the law.


## Understanding the Language of Data Protection
Before we dive into the Act's nuances and how they affect you as a consumer, it's vital to decode some key terminologies.

**Personal Data:** This is your individual information that can be used to identify you. It could be your name, an identification number like BVN, NIN, location data, or an online identifier like twiter username. It could also be related to your physical, psychological, cultural, social, or economic identity. Basically, if it's about you, it's your personal data.

**Data Subject:** That's you! As the data subject, you are the individual whose personal data is being processed or considered. The Data Protection Act is designed to protect you and your personal information.

**Data Controller:** This is the entity that determines how and why your personal data will be processed. It could be an individual, a private company, a public authority, or any other body. They're in charge of deciding what happens to your data.

**Data Processor:** This could be an individual or an organization that processes your personal data on behalf of the data controller. While they're not making the big decisions, they're the ones handling your data directly.

**Sensitive Personal Data:** This is a special category of personal data that reveals critical aspects of your identity. It includes things like genetic and biometric data used for identifying you uniquely, your race or ethnic origin, religious or similar beliefs, health status, sex life, political opinions or affiliations, and trade union memberships. Like persoanl data, this type of information is given extra protection because of its potential impact on your personal life.

**Processing:** This term covers just about anything that can be done with your personal data. It includes operations like collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction of your personal data. Basically, if someone is doing something with your data, they're processing it.


## The Data Protection Act: A Consumer's Ally
The Data Protection Act aims to put control of personal data back where it belongs - with you, the data subject. It provides a suite of rights and privileges designed to ensure transparency, control, and accountability in the collection and processing of your personal data. Here's what it means for you:

**Right to Access and Information:** You, as a data subject, have the right to know whether a data controller is processing your personal data. You can demand a clear picture of what data is being handled, who the recipients of this data are, the purpose behind this data usage, and the envisaged period for which this data will be stored. If your personal data was not collected directly from you, the data controller is obligated to provide any available information as to its source. You are also entitled to a copy of this data in a commonly used electronic format, ensuring transparency and visibility into data handling processes.

**Right to Correction and Deletion:** The Data Protection Act empowers you to demand the correction, or if not feasible, the deletion of any personal data that is inaccurate, out of date, incomplete, or misleading. The law places the onus of accuracy on the data controller, ensuring your personal data is accurate and up-to-date.

**Right to Withdraw Consent:** The Act allows you to revoke your consent to data processing at any given time. It establishes the principle that withdrawing consent should be as easy as giving it, making sure that your agreement to data processing is continually voluntary and informed.

**Right to Object:** If you feel uncomfortable with the way your personal data is being used, you have the right to object, particularly if this data processing is based on certain grounds or is being used for direct marketing purposes. Upon your objection, your data can no longer be used for these purposes.

**Right Against Automated Decision Making:** The Act also provides you with the right not to be subject to decisions made purely on the automated processing of personal data, which includes profiling. This guards against the risk of decisions being made without human intervention, ensuring fairness and accountability.

**Right to Data Portability:** The Act allows you to request your personal data in a commonly used, structured, and machine-readable format, providing you the freedom to transmit this data to another data controller without hindrance. Where technically possible, it even allows for the data to be transmitted directly from one data controller to another, ensuring your control over your personal data across different entities.

**Right to Protection in Case of Data Breaches:** In case of a personal data breach, the data controller must inform you without undue delay, using clear and simple language, and also provide advice on measures to mitigate the possible adverse effects of the data breach.

**Right to Civil Remedies:** If you suffer any injury, loss, or harm as a result of a violation of the Act by a data controller or processor, you have the right to recover damages through civil proceedings.















In a world where data has become a valuable commodity, its protection has become a topmost priority for individuals and businesses alike. In response to this, the Nigerian government has been taking steps to regulate the collection, processing, and storage of personal data. This journey has led to the recent signing into law of the Data Protection Act on June 14, 2023.

Despite the buzz generated by this significant legislative step, there appears to be some confusion amongst the general public about what this law truly entails. So, we'll be breaking down the key aspects of the new Data Protection Act, particularly as it applies to consumers and businesses.

Data Protection in Nigeria: A Brief History
The evolution of data protection frameworks in Nigeria started with the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, which under Section 37 guarantees the privacy of citizens, their homes, correspondence, telephone conversations, and telegraphic communications.

Following this, in 2013, the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) developed the Guidelines for Data Protection ("NITDA Guidelines") which set standards for the processing of identifiable individual's personal data. These guidelines were created to protect such information from inappropriate access, use, and disclosure.

Fast forward to 2019, NITDA released the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) to further safeguard the rights of Nigerian citizens and keep Nigerian businesses competitive globally. This paved the way for the culmination of efforts in June 2023, when the Nigeria Data Protection Act was signed into law by the President, giving the NDPR full legislative backing.

Decoding the Data Protection Act for Consumers
Contrary to some misconceptions, the Data Protection Act isn't about the protection of the cost of your internet data plan or the government wanting to surveil you. Rather, it's about protecting your personal data from being misused.

The Act aims to provide a stringent legal framework that regulates the processing of personal data, thereby protecting the privacy rights of individuals. It spells out the rights of the data subjects (you
