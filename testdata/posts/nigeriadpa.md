## A Brief History of Data Protection Laws in Nigeria
The road to data privacy in Nigeria has been an evolutionary process anchored by the constitutional provision for the right to privacy. Section 37 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria guarantees and protects the privacy of citizens, their homes, correspondence, telephone conversations, and telegraphic communications.

In 2013, the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) launched the NITDA Guidelines, setting standards for the processing of personal data, including its acquisition, handling, usage, and disclosure. Despite being a considerable leap towards data protection, these guidelines still left gaps that required a more comprehensive law.

The Nigerian Data Protection Regulation (NDPR), launched by NITDA in 2019, marked the next step in strengthening data protection, aiming to safeguard the rights of Nigerian citizens while also boosting the global competitiveness of Nigerian businesses.

Despite the strides made with the NDPR, it faced criticism due to its limited efficacy and enforceability, as it was not an Act of the National Assembly. This prompted the creation of the Data Protection Bill, which, on June 14, 2023, was signed into law by the President, officially becoming the Data Protection Act. This Act, being a comprehensive law, offers a binding legal framework for data protection in Nigeria.


## Understanding the Language of Data Protection
Before we dive into the Act's nuances and how they affect you as a consumer, it's vital to decode some key terminologies.

Personal Data: This is your individual information that can be used to identify you. It could be your name, an identification number, location data, or an online identifier. It could also be related to your physical, psychological, cultural, social, or economic identity. Basically, if it's about you, it's your personal data.

Data Subject: That's you! As the data subject, you are the individual whose personal data is being processed or considered. The Data Protection Act is designed to protect you and your personal information.

Data Controller: This is the entity that determines how and why your personal data will be processed. It could be an individual, a private company, a public authority, or any other body. They're in charge of deciding what happens to your data.

Data Processor: This could be an individual or an organization that processes your personal data on behalf of the data controller. While they're not making the big decisions, they're the ones handling your data directly.

Sensitive Data: This is a special category of personal data that reveals critical aspects of your identity. It could be your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, trade union memberships, genetic data, biometric data, health information, or details about your sex life or sexual orientation. This type of data is given extra protection under the law because of its sensitive nature.

Sensitive Personal Data: This is a more specific category of sensitive data. It includes things like genetic and biometric data used for identifying you uniquely, your race or ethnic origin, religious or similar beliefs, health status, sex life, political opinions or affiliations, and trade union memberships. Like sensitive data, this type of information is given extra protection because of its potential impact on your personal life.


## The Data Protection Act: A Consumer's Ally
The Data Protection Act aims to put control of personal data back where it belongs - with you, the data subject. It provides a suite of rights and privileges designed to ensure transparency, control, and accountability in the collection and processing of your personal data. Here's what it means for you:

















In a world where data has become a valuable commodity, its protection has become a topmost priority for individuals and businesses alike. In response to this, the Nigerian government has been taking steps to regulate the collection, processing, and storage of personal data. This journey has led to the recent signing into law of the Data Protection Act on June 14, 2023.

Despite the buzz generated by this significant legislative step, there appears to be some confusion amongst the general public about what this law truly entails. So, we'll be breaking down the key aspects of the new Data Protection Act, particularly as it applies to consumers and businesses.

Data Protection in Nigeria: A Brief History
The evolution of data protection frameworks in Nigeria started with the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, which under Section 37 guarantees the privacy of citizens, their homes, correspondence, telephone conversations, and telegraphic communications.

Following this, in 2013, the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) developed the Guidelines for Data Protection ("NITDA Guidelines") which set standards for the processing of identifiable individual's personal data. These guidelines were created to protect such information from inappropriate access, use, and disclosure.

Fast forward to 2019, NITDA released the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) to further safeguard the rights of Nigerian citizens and keep Nigerian businesses competitive globally. This paved the way for the culmination of efforts in June 2023, when the Nigeria Data Protection Act was signed into law by the President, giving the NDPR full legislative backing.

Decoding the Data Protection Act for Consumers
Contrary to some misconceptions, the Data Protection Act isn't about the protection of the cost of your internet data plan or the government wanting to surveil you. Rather, it's about protecting your personal data from being misused.

The Act aims to provide a stringent legal framework that regulates the processing of personal data, thereby protecting the privacy rights of individuals. It spells out the rights of the data subjects (you
