If you love tech entrepreneurship, venture capital, and invention like I do, you'll enjoy this post. Here, I will share helpful resources I used to learn about venture building and investing. This includes online courses, books, articles, and more. I hope they are helpful to you too!

Here are some key points about my journey:

My learning journey in venture building and investing began in 2020. I joined the Future VC â€“ Virtual Masterclasses. There, I learned about how money works in venture capital, how to raise funds, how to judge pitches, and the history of venture capital.
During these classes, I was paired with Rohit, a cybersecurity investor at Plug and Play. After the classes, I worked as a VentureCorps Analyst at AVG and as an Operations Associate/Chief of Staff at Roundtrip.
I am very thankful to the Future VC team, Rohit, Hillary, and Timi. They gave me a chance to learn about venture building and investing.
In early 2021, I started Robavo Expeditions (RobavoX). It is a lab and also an early-stage fund and venture studio. We focus on civic and deep tech projects. Through this lab, I've worked on a few projects with some very interesting people in tech and design.
