publish_date: 2024-01-01
abstract: This article is a personal reflection on the journey of embracing a life full of diverse passions, drawing parallels with Susan Fowler's concept of living without a singular destiny. Unlike my sisters, who have clear, focused career paths in business and medicine, I am navigating a world brimming with varied aspirations. These range from software security and aerospace engineering to politics and entrepreneurship. The piece explores the unique challenges and rewards of managing a wide array of interests. It draws inspiration from Paul Graham's insights on aligning work with natural abilities and interests and Susan Fowler's life story, it argues that great work is not confined to those with a single passion but is also achievable by those with multifaceted ambitions. The article is an ode to those who, like me, wish to explore multiple paths, highlighting how such a diverse journey can lead to exceptional achievements and a rich, fulfilling life.

## Many Dreams, Not Just One
In my family, everyone has their own dream. My older sister is all about business. She's been that way since she was young. My younger sister? She's working hard to become a computational medical doctor. They have one big dream each. But me? I'm different. I don't have just one dream; I have many. And sometimes, that makes things a bit confusing for me.

## Different From Others
I studied cybersecurity and computer science, but that's just the start. I want to do so much more. I dream of working in software security, but also in aerospace, starting and investing in businesses, being involved in politics, and even more. It's like having a box full of different colored threads, and I want to weave them all into one big, beautiful picture.

## What Paul Graham Says
Paul Graham, a legendary founder and investor guy who writes about technology entrepreneurship and venture capital, says you should work on things that match what you're good at and what you like. But what if you like a lot of things? Can you still do great work? I think yes. Having many interests means I can mix ideas from different places to make something new and special.

## The Challenge: Doing It All
The hard part is figuring out how to fit all these dreams into one life. It's like having a puzzle with so many pieces. I need to be smart about how I spend my time and energy. I need to learn a lot, plan well, and sometimes pick one thing to focus on, even just for a little while.

## Why It's Good to Want It All
Having lots of interests makes life exciting. You never get bored. You always learn new things. It's like going on many different adventures. And when you bring ideas from one adventure to another, sometimes you find something really special.

## My Goal for 2024
In the end, my story is about not being afraid to dream big and dream many. You don't have to pick just one thing to be good at or one dream to follow. Like weaving different threads into a tapestry, I'm learning how to bring all my dreams together in 2024. It's not always easy, but it's my way of doing great work, and I wouldn't have it any other way.
