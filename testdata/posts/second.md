Prifender is using artificial intelligence technology to discover and map personal information across networks and systems, both structured and unstructured, while associating identities with their respective obligations.

Using Prifender, organizations can better manage privacy and demonstrate accountability and compliance.

At Prifender, we developed capabilities that go to the heart of privacy management -- the control of the identities (data subjects) that make up the privacy obligations for the organization.

Prifender provides users with a practical way to view, control, report and query data to meet privacy obligations, key performance indicators, and review the activities that take place over millions of identities.

Using Prifender, enterprises can prove their regulatory compliance, avoid fines and improve customer satisfaction.

Data Protection Laws in Africa
I want to write about the evolution of data security and privacy laws across Africa and its current state. To start with, here are some basic facts about Africa:

There are 55 countries recognized by the African Union on the African Continent. 
These African countries are divided into five geographic regions.
  
  
| Region | Countries |
|---|---|
| Central Africa | Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of the Congo, DR Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, São Tomé and Príncipe |
| Eastern Africa | Comoros, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Rwanda, Seychelles, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda |
| Northern Africa | Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Sahrawi Republic, Tunisia |
| Southern Africa | Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia,  South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe |
| Western Africa | Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Côte d’Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Togo |

The main driver behind the rapid growth in privacy regulations across African countries appears to be Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation, which came into force in May 2018 with strict requirements and major consequences for non-compliance, though Ghana passed a data privacy law in 2012 and Morrocco in 2009 and most African countries have privacy enshrined in their constitutions. For example, Dection 37 of the 1999 Constitition of the Federal Republic of Nigeria provides for the right to privacy. In South Africa, privacy is enshrined as a fundamental human right in section 14 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa. It is further protected under the common law.Article 24 provides that any person has the right to the protection of their private life in Morrocco. The Kenyan Constitution protects the right to privacy under Article 31.

EU’s General Data Protection Regulation took effect three years ago today, elevating awareness of privacy and data protection from boardrooms to living rooms and setting a standard for countries and jurisdictions around the world.As the first comprehensive privacy laws. the EU's GDPR has inspired legislation around Africa countries, from Nigeria to Uganda to Kenya just to name a few. GDPR served as a template for most of these data protection laws and proposed draft laws 

The African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection (the “Malabo Convention”) is set to come into force after Mauritania became the 15th state to submit its ratification. The Convention, which the AU Assembly adopted in 2014, aims to create a comprehensive legal framework for electronic commerce, data protection, and cybercrime and cybersecurity on the continent. Once the Malabo Convention is operational, all 55 AU member states are mandated to have domestic laws in each of these policy areas which conform to various standards and principles outlined in the Convention.

The AU’s latest status list on the Malabo Convention, dated 12 May 2023, lists the following 15 states as having submitted ratification:

Angola (11 May 2020), Cape Verde (5 February 2022), Côte d’Ivoire (3 April 2023), Congo (23 October 2020), Ghana (3 June 2019), Guinea (16 October 2018), Mozambique (21 January 2020), Mauritania (9 May 2023), Mauritius (14 March 2018), Namibia (1 February 2019), Niger (16 March 2022), Rwanda (21 November 2019), Senegal (16 August 2016), Togo (19 October 2021), and Zambia (24 March 2021).

In addition, the following states are listed as having signed the Malabo Convention without yet ratifying it:

Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Comoros, Djibouti, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, South Africa, Sierra Leone, Sao Tome and Principe, Sudan, and Tunisia.





regulations,
like HIPAA in the U.S., the EU’s pending
ePrivacy Regulation, Canada’s anti-spam
law CASL, and cybersecurity laws in China
and Russia, will continue to drive the
market. Growing consumer awareness of
data breaches and their increasing demands
that companies protect their information,
are also, in part, heating up development
