abstract: The African space sector, although gradually progressing with 53 satellites launched from 15 countries as of April 2023, still faces considerable challenges such as limited indigenous expertise, heavy dependence on foreign entities like China, Europe, and the USA, and scarce space-related education. This paper explores these challenges and introduces Robavo Space Technologies, an innovative, full-stack space-as-a-service company poised to transform the African space industry. Robavo Space's strategic offerings include the development of cost-effective payloads and satellite buses, efficient launch brokerage services capitalizing on Africa's geographical advantages, and initiatives to foster space education and skills development. The company also presents a platform for data analytics using space-derived data. By enabling self-reliance, reducing costs, and cultivating a skilled workforce, Robavo Space presents a comprehensive solution with potential to reshape the African space landscape. The paper calls for further research into the impacts and scalability of this transformative approach.s.
