## Abstract

As of April 14, 2023, Africa has seen the launch of 53 satellites by 15 national space agencies and nine commercial entities. Despite the significant strides in the continent's space activity, the current approach often involves high-cost outsourcing to foreign countries for satellite construction and launch, limiting accessibility and indigenous participation in space technology development.

This paper introduces Robavo Space, an innovative solution aiming to disrupt this status quo by promoting affordable and accessible space technology in Africa. Robavo Space, a full-stack space-as-a-service company, offers comprehensive solutions covering space education and training, space data analytics, satellite development, launch brokerage, and delivery of required services, enabling African nations and businesses to leverage space technologies more affordably and efficiently.

The motivation for Robavo Space arose from the identified gaps in the African space industry and a case study of Nigeria's space program. Despite the billion-dollar investment in satellite research and development, Nigeria's program lacks robust satellite or launch vehicle manufacturing capability, relying heavily on foreign-built satellites and launch services. This scenario reflects the common reality for many African nations, emphasizing the urgent need for a shift towards self-reliance in the space sector.

Robavo Space's services include the development of low-cost, mass-produced payloads and satellite buses tailored for small satellites and the brokering of launch services. The company's strategy takes advantage of Africa's equatorial location for efficient rocket launching and reduced fuel consumption, promising increased payload capacities.

In essence, Robavo Space's endeavor can significantly enhance Africa's autonomous capabilities in the space industry, potentially stimulating socio-economic growth, driving technological innovation, and fostering human capital development across the continent. Future research would explore the broad impacts and scalability of such an approach within the fast-evolving African space industry.
