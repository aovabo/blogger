publish_date: 2023-05-30
abstract: In response to OpenAI's Cybersecurity Grant Program, this paper introduces ADASCA: An AI-Driven Approach to Enhance Data Protection Compliance and Strengthen Cybersecurity Controls in Africa. ADASCA is designed to revolutionize data protection compliance and elevate cybersecurity postures across the African continent.
