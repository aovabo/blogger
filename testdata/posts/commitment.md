## Introduction

Love has a profound way of shaping our lives. It can lead us down paths we never anticipated, challenge us in ways we never expected, and transform us in ways we never imagined. My first journey down this winding path of love was anything but conventional.

Prior to September 12, 2023, my life was bereft of romantic entanglements. I had never experienced the heady rush of a first date or the warmth of a stolen kiss. But destiny has a peculiar sense of humor. It chose to thrust me headfirst into the deep end, from never having dated to standing before a court clerk, saying 'I do'.

Our wedding was held not amidst the chatter of relatives and the aroma of flowers but within the solemn, hallowed halls of a courthouse. This wasn't a spontaneous dash to a Vegas chapel or an impulsive declaration of young love. Our marriage was born out of pragmatism, a solution to a difficult situation we found ourselves tangled in. But amidst the legal documents and quick vows, we made a solemn pact to commit to this marriage fully. We were determined to give this partnership a fighting chance, to prove to ourselves and the world that our bond was not merely ink on a marriage certificate but a bond of love and mutual respect.

And for a while, it felt like we might succeed. Like any couple, we had our disagreements, but they seemed nothing out of the ordinary. I was in it for the long haul, ready to weather whatever storms came our way.

**Then, the storm hit.**

Slowly, and then all at once, the veneer started to chip away. The woman I had pledged to share my life with, my first and only love, was slipping away into the arms of others. I tried to overlook the signs, clinging onto the hope that I was just being paranoid. But as the evidence mounted, I could no longer turn a blind eye.

This week, I hit my breaking point. And when I finally found the courage to confront her, to voice the pain that had been gnawing at my heart, I was met with deflection and gaslighting. My concerns were brushed aside, my feelings trivialized, and I was painted as the villain in a narrative I did not pen.

But amidst this turmoil, I am not seeking solace in silence. I'm here, sharing my story, laying bare my heartache, in the hope that my journey might offer solace to someone else navigating the stormy seas of love and betrayal. As I chronicle my experiences of love, betrayal, gaslighting, and survival, I hope to unravel the complexities of infidelity and the devastating impact it can have on the innocent party.

In sharing my story, I am seeking to reclaim my narrative, to assert that it's okay to speak up, to demand honesty and respect in a relationship. Because while I may have been thrust into an unconventional marriage, I was and still am, committed to the principles of truth, respect, and integrity. And it is those principles that guide me as I navigate these troubled waters.
