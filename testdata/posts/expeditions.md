In this piece, I'll share my journey into tech entrepreneurship, venture capital, and invention, and the resources that guided me. I hope it's just as interesting for you as it was for me!

My adventure started in 2020 with Future VC's Virtual Masterclasses, where I learned the nitty-gritty of venture capital. I was fortunate to work alongside Rohit, a cybersecurity investor at Plug and Play during the program, and later, I had the opportunity to work as a [VentureCorps Analyst](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/alex-ovabor) at AVG and as an [Operations Associate/Chief of Staff](https://www.roundtripafrika.com/people) at Roundtrip.

In March 2022, I completed Doriot Academy's Startup Investing Course and became a [Sophisticated Startup Investor](https://www.credential.net/06e4482c-1f2c-464f-a902-61f01c7d4469#gs.0rn94q). 

Then, in early 2021, I took a big step and started [Robavo Expeditions](https://www.robavo.xyz) and [Ovabor Development Labs](https://www.ovabor.xyz), where I work on civic and deep tech projects with some of the brightest minds in tech and design.

**I owe a lot of my learning and growth to the Future VC team, Rohit, Hillary, Timi, Gigi, and Olumide.**

## My Role at Ovabor Labs: Building and Growing Ideas

At Ovabor Labs, our mission is to create the next wave of groundbreaking civic and deep tech companies. I spend a lot of my time coming up with and testing new ideas.  I also work on making the lab better through learning experiments and big ideas. My job involves planning the way forward and checking the ideas for any technical, business, or product risks. It's also my job to decide whether to go ahead with or drop an idea. 

**We have a robust process in place that either validates these ideas or, if they don't measure up, ruthlessly discards them.**
The best ideas undergo an iterative product development process, with our sights constantly trained on their potential to evolve into businesses worthy of venture backing. When we're fully confident about a business concept's potential, we invest substantial time and resources to transform these ideas into venture-funded companies that quickly find favour with customers and markets.

I also keep up-to-date with scientific research, articles, and patents that are related to what we do at Ovabor Labs. I keep an eye on market trends, competition, and important changes in the industry. I work to connect with important people, competitors, and experts, and I make investment plans based on our research.

For each project, I look at the key scientific and technical risks. I also identify who could be competitors or partners for the project. I check the project's R&D plan and business strategy, and help prepare notes for internal investment meetings, which includes making pitch decks.
