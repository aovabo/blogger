## Introduction
Over the past few months, Nigeria has been experiencing some significant policy changes. The new president, who took office on May 29, 2023, inherited a challenging economic situation. The previous administration left a staggering debt of N49.85 trillion ($108.30 billion) to local and foreign creditors. Consequently, 96 percent of the government's revenue is now being used to service this debt. With fears of an escalating cash crunch if subsidy payments continued, the new administration has implemented substantial fiscal and monetary policy shifts that are currently shaping the nation's economic landscape.  From the removal of fuel subsidy to the authorization given by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for commercial banks to sell foreign exchange freely at market-determined rates, the effects of these policies are palpable across various sectors.

## Fiscal and Monetary Policy Shifts: Impacts and Ramifications
In his inauguration speech on May 29, 2023, the president announced the removal of the fuel subsidy policy. The immediate past president only provided budgetary allocation for petrol subsidy until June 30, 2023, leaving the incoming administration to make the final decision. The fuel subsidy removal policy went into effect on July 1, 2023.

This announcement was a decisive response to the government's budgetary constraint, as the cash crunch could worsen if subsidy payments were to continue. Concurrently, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) authorized commercial banks to sell foreign exchange freely at market-determined rates.

These changes, combined with the ongoing debt servicing, have led to a significant rise in the cost of goods and services. Transportation has become expensive, food prices have soared, and the cost of fuel for generators - a necessity due to Nigeria's unstable electricity supply - has spiked significantly.

To give some context, the fuel subsidy removal policy went into effect on July 1, 2023, and the CBN announced operational changes to the foreign exchange market on June 14, 2023. The government of the immediate past President, Muhammadu Buhari, only provided budgetary allocation for petrol subsidy until June 30, 2023, after saying it would leave the incoming administration to make a final decision on the matter.

This leaves the new administration grappling with the repercussions of the previous government's economic decisions while trying to steer the country towards fiscal stability and growth.
