# Electrons and Algorithms: Surprises, some laughs, and a few huh?

Hello! I've spent a month with my new **Tesla Model 3**,, and oh boy, it's been a ride full of surprises and learning curves. And through it all, I've got my eyes on a big prize: a Tesla Roadster and finding several bugs in the vehicle.

## The Exciting Start

Getting my Tesla was a big deal for me. It's like having a piece of the future right in my parking spot. But, it wasn't all smooth sailing. For starters, the wipers would go off on sunny days. Yep, no rain, just wipers having a party on their own because of some software glitch.

## Autopilot Adventures (and Misadventures)

The Autopilot feature is something else. It's great when it works, like helping me stay in my lane in a snowstorm. But sometimes, it gets a bit too jumpy, braking for imaginary obstacles and getting confused by road markings.

## The Cost of Adventure

All these little tech hiccups did a number on my insurance premium, shooting it up from $65 to a whopping $186 a month. Well, every time the Autopilot got jittery and braked for no reason, it dinged my safety score. Higher risk on paper meant higher insurance in reality. Ouch.


## Chasing the Dream

But here's the twist: I love a good tech challenge. I'm diving into the world of automotive cybersecurity, hunting for bugs in the hopes of making my Tesla safer and inching closer to my ultimate goal, the Tesla Roadster.

## Rolling with the Punches

So, what's the verdict after a month? It's been a mix of fun, frustration, and fascination. The Model 3 is more than a car to me; it's a puzzle, a teacher, and a stepping stone to my Roadster dream.

Here's to more discoveries, fixes, and hopefully, one day, that dream Roadster in my garage. Cheers to the journey ahead!
