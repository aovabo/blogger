## The Shaking Ground of Nigeria's Economy
Upon the inauguration of our new president on May 29, 2023, sweeping changes took the economic stage of Nigeria. The removal of the fuel subsidy and the freeing of foreign exchange rates by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) triggered seismic shifts in our economy, shaking up sectors across the nation.

Behind this landmark policy shift was an economic legacy left by the previous administration, with a staggering debt of ₦49.85 trillion ($108.30 billion) awaiting its successors. This debt burden, consuming a whopping 96% of government revenue, made maintaining the fuel subsidy an unsustainable option. The consequent removal of the subsidy triggered a wave of immediate and intense effects on ordinary people.

## The Ripple Effects of Subsidy Removal and Foreign Exchange Liberalization
The economic shockwaves resulting from the fuel subsidy removal and the changes in foreign exchange operations have intensified costs for consumers and businesses alike. Everyday items have become more expensive, pinching the pockets of everyone—especially when you consider our sky-high inflation rate of 22.79% as of June 2023. This inflation not only erodes the value of our money but also inflates our national debt.

Businesses are also feeling the heat. The fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate, standing at ₦806 naira to a $1 dollar, coupled with the increase in fuel prices to ₦617 per liter as of July 18, 2023, have hiked operating costs and stifled investment opportunities.

## Introduction
Over the past few months, Nigeria has been experiencing some significant policy changes, which have had profound impacts on the economy. These changes began when the new president took office on May 29, 2023. His administration implemented new fiscal and monetary policies which are altering the economic landscape of the country. From the removal of fuel subsidy to the authorization given by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for commercial banks to sell foreign exchange freely at market-determined rates. This has presented both challenges and opportunities within the economic landscape, the effects of which are rippling throughout the nation across various sectors.

## Setting the Stage: Economic Challenges
The backdrop to this momentous policy shift is an economic legacy left by the immediate past President, whose administration only provided budgetary allocation for petrol subsidy until June 30, 2023, leaving the incoming administration to make the final decision. The adminstration also left a staggering debt of ₦49.85 trillion ($108.30 billion) to local and foreign creditors. Consequently, 96 percent of government revenue goes towards servicing this debt, raising fears of a more severe cash crunch if subsidy payments were to continue. It is against this backdrop that the fuel subsidy removal was announced, creating a ripple of immediate and palpable effects on the populace.

## Fiscal and Monetary Policy Shifts: Impacts and Ramifications
The removal of the fuel subsidy, which came into effect on July 1, 2023, along with the new operational changes to the foreign exchange market, announced by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on June 14, 2023 that authorized commercial banks to sell foreign exchange freely at market-determined rates have caused significant changes in the market.

For consumers, these changes have led to a hike in the cost of goods and services, including transportation and food, and a notable rise in fuel costs for generators - an essential item due to Nigeria's unstable electricity supply. This situation is further compounded by the nation's high inflation rate of 22.79 percent (as of June 2023), which is negatively impacting consumer confidence and the cost of living. Inflation is the rate at which prices for goods and services increase, affects various facets of the economy. It impacts individual spending power and can affect the interest on the national debt. The rate at which prices change can have wide-ranging consequences across the economy. When inflation rises, the value of money erodes, and this can result in wage devaluation, increased living costs, and reduced purchasing power.

For businesses, these challenges translate to increased costs, reduced demand, stymied investments, and disruptions in supply chains. The overall economic environment is further strained by fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate, which stood at ₦806 naira to a $1 dollar, and the increase in fuel prices to ₦617 per liter as of July 18, 2023.

## The Fuel Subsidy: A History
Introduced in the 1970s, the fuel subsidy kept fuel prices affordable for decades, shielding Nigeria's estimated 200 million citizens from the high costs of refining oil in Europe and reimporting it back into the country. However, the subsidy grew increasingly expensive, costing the government over ₦4 trillion naira ($10bn) in 2022 alone. Subsidy payments have always been plagued by corruption and a lack of fiscal transparency, with a 2012 parliamentary inquiry uncovering a $6bn fraud involving the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) officials.

Fuel subsidies have been a controversial topic in Nigeria, with many considering them a significant benefit from the federal government. In 2012, when then-president Goodluck Jonathan attempted to remove the subsidy, it sparked widespread protests that brought the country to a standstill. However, the subsidies became an increasingly heavy burden, culminating in their removal in 2023 by President Bola Tinubu.

## Impact of Subsidy Removal and Currency Float
The story of Nigeria's economy can't be told without referring to the Naira, our national currency. The journey has been a rocky one. We once had a time when the Naira was stronger than the U.S Dollar, with one Naira trading for more than a Dollar in the late 80s. But times have changed.

Fast forward to 2016, Nigeria attempted to float the Naira in response to the economic crisis triggered by the crash in global oil prices. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) announced a "managed float", allowing the currency's value to be determined by market forces. However, this policy was plagued with challenges, and the Naira continued to struggle amidst dwindling foreign reserves and a wide disparity between official and black market rates.

With the removal of the subsidy and the decision to float the Naira, the government no longer needed to provide dollars to control petrol costs, and the Central Bank could no longer dictate exchange rates. Now, buyers and sellers in the official FX market can quote rates they find comfortable, giving rise to a more free-market economic structure. This change means that the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL) will no longer be the sole supplier of petrol, with 56 private firms licensed to import petrol.

## Turning the Tide with Dangote Refinery
In a bid to end fuel imports and mitigate the impact of these changes, Nigeria commissioned the Dangote Refinery on May 22, 2023. This refinery, boasting a capacity of 650,000 barrels per day, aims to turn Nigeria, which is Africa’s biggest oil producer into an export hub for petroleum products. Despite challenges posed by oil theft, vandalism of pipelines, and underinvestment affecting the Nigeria's crude supply, its operation could significantly reshape Nigeria's energy landscape.

## Nigeria's Reliance on Imports
One of the persistent issues is Nigeria's high dependence on imports. Despite being the largest economy in Africa and a significant oil producer, the country's production capacity has not kept up with its growing population. From a population of 180 million in 2017, current estimates now put the figure at around 220 million, indicating a substantial increase that the domestic production has struggled to keep up with. As a result, Nigeria continues to import a significant amount of goods to meet local demand.

Moreover, the lack of domestic capacity also extends to the refining sector. Nigeria imports almost all its refined fuel due to inadequate refining capacity and neglect of existing refineries. This has resulted in the high costs of fuel imports, which accounted for $23.3bn in 2022 alone. Unless Nigeria can significantly ramp up its domestic production and refining capacity to reduce its reliance on imports, inflation could set in, potentially destabilizing the economy.

## Endemic Corruption
Corruption, unfortunately, continues to be a widespread problem in Nigeria, both at high and low levels of society. Despite numerous campaigns and initiatives to combat corruption, the problem persists. This endemic corruption has a significant impact on the economy, diverting resources meant for development and hindering growth.

Currency speculators and other bad actors exploit the system for their benefit, adding another layer of complexity to Nigeria's economic challenges. Notably, the removal of fuel subsidies has not eliminated these corrupt practices, with illicit activities continuing to plague the country's economic landscape.

These challenges underscore the complexity of Nigeria's economic situation. While the removal of fuel subsidies and the floating of the currency are steps towards liberalizing the economy, they must be part of a broader package of reforms. Unless Nigeria can effectively address these issues, its journey towards sustainable economic growth could remain fraught with challenges.

## Investing in Nigeria's Future Amid Economic Tides
In light of these realities, I am restructuring Ovabor Development Labs Limited into a diversified holding company. I'm expanding our scope, moving beyond only incubating and investing in civic, deep tech and SaaS products to acquring and investing in everyday Nigerian businesses across variuos sectors like oil and gas, restaurants, bookstores, newspapers, insurance companies, and beyond. I see potential in local businesses that need the right kind of support to thrive amid these economic uncertainties. I personally have a personal reservation about private equity approach to buying and taking over companies, which is why I have always been in favor of venture capital approach. I will develop my own modus operandi to run this experiment. 

So, what am I looking for in these businesses? The answer is threefold: cash generation, effective management, and growth potential. I am on the lookout for businesses that demonstrate strong cash flows, are led by dedicated and proficient management teams, and exhibit high growth prospects.

This isn't just about making money; it's about playing a role in building a stronger Nigeria. After all, if the local businesses thrive, our economy thrives.

This new direction is a personal choice. One that comes from my desire to see Nigeria rise above its current challenges. So if you know any nigeria companies struggling in these sectors and they are looking sell their businesses, please reach out to me 36vest@ovabor.com
