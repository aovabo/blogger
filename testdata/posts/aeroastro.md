I have put together a great studying resource for anyone interested in spacecraft and rockets [1]. The study of spacecraft and rockets is a fascinating endeavor that can take you on amazing adventures. It can also lead to an exciting career in the aerospace industry. But even if you never pursue a career in this field, learning about spacecraft and rockets will give you a deeper understanding of our universe and our place within it. So what are you waiting for? Start teaching yourself aerospace engineering [2] today!



Notes:


[1] If you're like me (space enthusiast) and you're interested in small satellites development or liquid rocket engine design philosophy as well as its combustion dynamics then please consider exploring this resource! It has a wealth of information on both subjects, and it's constantly being updated with new content.

[2] Aerospace engineering is the primary field of engineering concerned with the design, development, testing and production of aircraft, spacecraft, and rockets. It has two major branches: aeronautical engineering and astronautical engineering. Aeronautical engineers primarily focus on aircraft while astronautical engineers focus on spacecraft and rockets.
