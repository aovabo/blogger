### Introduction
As we adapt to the conveniences of digital financial platforms like OPay and PalmPay, concerns around privacy and data security are looming larger than ever. Many users have reported instances of their phone numbers being registered on these platforms without their consent, prompting serious discussions about legality and user rights.


### Open Banking Explained
Open banking refers to a system where third-party financial providers can access your banking data and execute transactions through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). In simpler terms, it allows other companies to access your financial information to provide additional services, ideally, giving you more control and flexibility over your financial data.

However, open banking raises inevitable questions about privacy and security. The interconnected web involving the user, the app, the API, and the bank opens multiple avenues for potential data breaches, with the user’s personal data at risk of being compromised or sold to unauthorized entities.

### Privacy Concerns in Open Banking
The privacy concerns in open banking center around the transfer of Personal Identifiable Information (PII) from banks to third-party providers. The detailed personal information shared can potentially be sold or used by these providers, often without the user’s explicit knowledge or consent, raising significant ethical and legal questions.


### How OPay and PalmPay Operate
OPay and PalmPay are platforms known for their user-friendly financial services, which allow phone numbers to act as account numbers. Recent user reports suggest that these platforms might be registering phone numbers without user consent, and people find their names listed on these platforms even if they never registered.

### Data Protection Act and Legal Provisions
The Nigeria Data Protection Act, 2023 mandates that personal data can only be processed with explicit consent and for legitimate purposes. It also dictates that such data should be adequate, relevant, and not misleading, emphasizing the importance of maintaining data accuracy, completeness, and security. Any breach of these provisions could lead to serious legal implications for the involved entities.

### Mono Lookup
Mono has introduced a product, Mono Lookup, designed to simplify the identity verification process. It includes features like:

- Account Number Lookup: Verifies user's financial account ownership using account numbers.
- 360-view Lookup: Provides a comprehensive view of all bank accounts linked to a customer using their BVN or phone number.
- BVN Lookup: Securely retrieves users’ BVN data with their consent.

### How Does Mono Lookup Help?
Mono Lookup aids in:

- Financial Account Verification: Automatic checking and returning of verified account information, removing manual checks and powering a more secure and seamless account verification process.

### What Does This Mean for You?
The use of products like Mono Lookup, coupled with platforms like OPay and PalmPay, while convenient, emphasizes the need for increased awareness and vigilance about data privacy and consent. It is imperative for users to understand the kind of data being accessed and to ensure they are comfortable with how it is being used.
