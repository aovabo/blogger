Hey there! Interested in the world of cyber security and IT? I've been in your shoes, and now I want to give back.

**Why?** 

Simply put, I'm a bit bored and believe knowledge is for sharing. And what better way to share than to guide budding enthusiasts on the path to mastery?

**Here's the plan**:

I'm launching a virtual security and privacy training program. This will not just be another run-of-the-mill program. It's tailored, hands-on, and aimed at taking you from knowing zero to understanding the core fundamentals.

### What's the catch?

Well, there isn’t really one. The tuition? **It’s free**. But there's a twist. 

To be a part of this exclusive training cohort, all I ask is for a donation between **$500 to $1500** to the **charity of my choice**. This isn't for me – it's my way of paying forward to the institution that equipped me with the knowledge I have today. Show me the proof of your donation, and you're in!

### Why the donation?

My mother always said we shouldn’t sell our knowledge. So, rather than charge for this program, I decided that the proceeds should go to a place of learning that has given me so much.

### Extra Perks:

* **Hands-on Learning**: Real-world scenarios to test and solidify your understanding.
* **Internship Opportunity**: Once the course wraps up, dive into an unpaid internship with one of my companies. It's all about applying what you learn and gaining that invaluable experience.

### Interested?

We're keeping it cozy for now, with only **10 spots** available. So, if you want to be part of this pioneering cohort, register [here](<https://forms.gle/DcgigfrBJohAhgv89>).
