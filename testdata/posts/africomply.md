In the digital age, data is the new oil that powers businesses. Organizations heavily rely on data to drive their operations, and there's no sign that this dependence is slowing down. As the volume of data continues to grow, African organizations need to move beyond viewing data security privacy compliance as a mere checklist managed with surveys and spreadsheets. Data privacy is no longer merely a legal challenge that large law firms and consulting companies can solve with conventional privacy policies and abstract implementations. The emergence of complex data protection laws in Africa calls for a revolutionary approach. Businesses need to automate their practices to stay on top of compliance requirements, and privacy should no longer be an afterthought for developers.


Understanding this crucial need for data privacy and security, I embarked on a journey to provide a comprehensive solution, leading to the creation of AfriComply. Having studied computer science with a focus on cybersecurity, and having experienced the challenges of data privacy compliance first-hand through my work in IT and various projects, I felt a compelling urge to fill this gap. In an effort to comprehend the diverse data protection regulations in Africa, I dove into extensive research and discussions with key players in the field, including a prominent data protection lawyer, Lawyer V, and a renowned Governance, Risk, and Compliance Analyst M in Nigeria. Their insights further emphasized the necessity of a user-friendly yet powerful privacy product that could cater to lawyers, consultants, data protection officers, as well as developers and data scientists.

Driven by these insights and extensive research into the existing data protection legislations, AfriComply aims to address the following core aspects of privacy compliance:

1. Personal Data: Helping organizations understand what personal data they collect.
2. Data Store: Identifying where the collected data is stored.
3. Compute: Establishing where personal data processing takes place.
4. Sharing: Determining who the data is shared with and the reasons for sharing.
5. Security: Ensuring the robust security of the systems involved.

Alongside these, AfriComply also focuses on understanding how the definition of “personal information” varies across different African countries, categorizing personal data by type, understanding why businesses collect and process data, and examining how data protection legislation affects cross-border transfers and automated processing.

In addition to addressing these core privacy compliance facets, AfriComply is equipped to automate several tedious and error-prone manual processes:
